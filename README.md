# Establishing an objective

It's been 3 days i've been working on this 'project' and i've not idea what i'm doing so far
I'm trying to create some simulating implying multiple players against some monsters, but would I not work on Kamlot, now I have SFML's basics ?
I guess I could try some human interaction such as a character moving using keyboard's input...

I believe I had some idea of what I was doing at the beginning, something like the "Game of Life", but it got weird after i thought about the 10 possible features I could add...


# About the gameplay of the 'new version'

Could try drawing few sprites of a character, moving it

# Wait... I do remember something now...

What about, creating a game from code, this wouldn't be my part, hahaha, but the player's part. // Perhaps this is a bad idea since this is what we basically call "Coding", we'd just ask the player to code its game... nonsense BUT
We can try something like "Creeps" where you code the game, and the player just code the gameplay.

I kinda want to keep doing simulation...
I guess I could do a big sandbox where you set up rules and the game uses the rules to work...

What about simulating IA ?
=> OpenAI hide and seek <3

Dang let's do pathfinding visualization -- Will help for Kamlot anyway
